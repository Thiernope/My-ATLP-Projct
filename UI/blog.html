List of Insects That Eat Dead Flesh
Updated May 01, 2018
By Karen G Blaettler
Annoying, buzzing flies seem to show up at the least opportune times. Any warm weather outdoor event attracts these creatures, and they hover at the door in the hope of an opportunity to sneak inside. Flies won't go away, no matter how much slapping and flapping takes place. Fly swatters, fly tape, electronic fly traps and the common dish towel – none eliminate these pesky pests. So, what purpose do they have? Well, flies serve many important purposes.

TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)
True flies, members of the Insecta order Diptera, include more than 110,000 species. These flies pollinate many plants, including the chocolate-producing cacao tree. True flies fill ecological niches as predators, parasites and prey. Some true flies, particularly when in their larval stages, also act as decomposers. Certain members of Diptera, especially house flies and mosquitoes, spread diseases in the process of their normal activities.

Any Other Name
True flies belong to phylum Arthropoda, class Insecta and order Diptera. The true flies include more than 110,000 species and typically have only one pair of wings and a pair of balancing organs called halteres located at the base of each wing. A few species do not fly but live as parasites or on islands or alpine areas. True fly species range from crane flies to fruit flies, as well as bee mimics like bee flies and hoverflies, and the ever-annoying friendly flies, midges, blow flies and face flies. Perhaps the most famous members of Diptera are house flies and mosquitoes. Despite their reputations as disease-carrying annoyances, true flies fill critical roles in nature.
